# MPPT-Solar-Optimizer
mppt charge controller 

This is a .slx file to establish a solar charging station for batteries i.e can be used in EV charging infrastructure by making use of a boost converter to do so with a charge controller that uses Maximum Power POint Tracking.

The MPPT solar charge controller is a DC-to-DC converter for your solar power system. It receives voltage from the solar panels and converts it to charge your battery at a more appropriate level. The optimization helps you avoid losing some energy your system captures and generates, maximizing what you can store and use.
MPPT stands for Maximum Power Point Tracking. A solar panel has different electric output and different maximum efficiency levels. The efficiency depends on numerous factors, such as the time of day, cloud cover, and temperature of the panels. The MPPT identifies the point at which your system gets maximum efficiency.

Findings: solar output is dependent on irradiation and solar output reduces with increase in temperature
